# An example task that grabs a value from a setup's hardware variables
# Does not require any hardware except micropython board.
# Any variable beginning with "v.hw_" is treated as a hardware variable
# Hardware variables can be assigned values by going to the setups tab, selecting a named setup, and clicking the "variables" button to bring up the hardware variables dialog
# A hardware variable must first be added to a task file before it will be available for editing in the hardware variables dialog
