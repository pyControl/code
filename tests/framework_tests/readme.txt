This folder contains pyControl tasks designed to test different aspects of framework functionality.  The tests can be run on a pyboard without any additional hardware. A desription at the top of each task file says what the expected behaviour should be if the framework is working OK.  The test are intended to be used to check for problems following modifications to the framework.  They do not provide complete coverage of all framework functionality.
