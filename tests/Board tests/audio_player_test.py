# Connect breakout board 1.2 to the computer, plug in the 12V power supply.  
# Connect an audio player to port 1 on the breakout board and plug a speaker into
# each of the two speaker sockets.  Get a micro SD card, format it in FAT32, create 
# a folder on the SD card called '01' and put a short wav file with name '001.wav' 
# in the folder.  You can use a wav file from the sample pack that can be 
# downloaded from this address address: http://smd-records.com/tr808/?page_id=14 
# Put the folder in the SD card socket on the audio player. Run the task and the 
# wav file should play alternately from each speaker at two different volumes.
