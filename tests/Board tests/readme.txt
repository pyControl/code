This folder contains a set of pyControl task files for testing pyControl boards.  To use them copy the files into your 'pyControl/tasks' folder, then follow the instructions at the top of the each file to connect up the hardware.  Once the hardware is connected, use the pyControl GUI to run the test (see https://pycontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#getting-started).  The instructions at the top of each file indicate what the hardware should do when the test is run.
