# Install the driver file for the Lickometer (see

# Connect breakout board 1.2 to the computer, plug in the 12V power supply.  
# Connect a Lickometer to port 1 of the breakout board. Plug a houselight into

# connection between LK1 and GND the houselight connected to SOL-1 will turn on.
# When you make an electrical connection between LK2 and GND the houselight
